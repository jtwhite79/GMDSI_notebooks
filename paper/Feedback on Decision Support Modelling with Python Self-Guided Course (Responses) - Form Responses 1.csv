Explicitly stating what conclusions can be made from the examples and what cannot. Linking things back to changes in input files is also a useful reminder to people of what the scripts are actually doing.

A lot to digest and unfortunatly not enough available time for me to digest it all. But with all the very well documented notebooks, I'll review it at my own pace and will integrate PEST++ in my routine workflow. Thanks heaps for organising the training.    "

However, I am still many steps behind and still using PEST (no ++ yet). So even though I could follow and learn a lot, some of the practical problems I am having with the projects I am working on probably relate to the first couple of weeks. "

I definitely let myself down in falling a bit behind in not always completing all of the ""homework"" notebooks and not trying to apply it to a problem of my own. I definitely feel much more comfortable with the concepts but still feel very fuzzy on actually applying this to a ""real"" problem. Very grateful for the recordings so I can revisit all this material and sit with it a bit more. I'm curious to how an intensive, all at once, live in the firehose, workshop would feel and if that would lead to more engagement and retention of material. I'm also looking forward to using the forum and think that's a great space.  Big thanks to everyone who worked on this course."

Providing more of these types of demonstrations in class, and explaining what ""practical"" difficulties arose in using PEST++ tools, and how these were overcome, would likely add more value. But the course itself, including the notebooks, were incredibly helpful. Thank you very much for putting together this course."

Unfortunately, I didn't have the willpower to make myself do all these notebooks outside of work hours as much as I would have liked. I think that I learn best when I'm forced to do something (such as getting put on a project using it where I HAVE to do it or else lose my job, lol).
I think that an intensive in-person class would do the same thing for me. External motivation would definitely help ME, though others may have had an easier time with this format.
As far as the content and structure of the notebooks: AMAZING. Truly great resource that I will draw from for as long as I do groundwater modeling."
10/20/2023 1:57:32,this hybrid self-guided approach with few online meetings (as we have experienced now),I did a bit but fell behind,4,3,"1. Overall, I really liked this class. It was super helpful, the instructors were great, and the notebooks were very informative.
2. I'm a consultant, so given my workload, it was difficult to really digest and complete the notebooks in time for the next weekly meeting. My suggestion is to make this a 10-week experience, with meetings every two weeks. This would give attendees more time to dive into the notebooks and complete them
3. A one week intensive workshop (similar to what John Doherty provides with PEST) would also be helpful and something I would attend. If this is every setup, I would recommend releasing the materials several months in advance of the workshop, so folks can go through the material prior to the class.
4. A hybrid  self guided course or one week intensive workshop on PEST++ only would also be super helpful.

Feedback:
1.) Plan for 1.5-hour sessions. It seems like we went about that long most weeks. I think most folks prefer to plan for 1.5-hours and then have a shorter session, than vis versa. There were a couple of weeks that I made it to other meetings late because I didn't want to drop off this call early.

2.) I think the live coding was really instructive. Thanks for being brave enough to do it! Seeing all the little errors, corrections, and tweaks needed to get things to run as expected was helpful and one of my favorite parts."

It'd be cool to incorporate an unstructured grid example..."
10/20/2023 2:50:57,this hybrid self-guided approach with few online meetings (as we have experienced now),I did a bit but fell behind,4,3,"First of all, thanks for doing this!. It was very helpful in giving me the push to finally start seriously learning more of this.

In my opinion, the notebooks presented here have a very specific workflow behind: MF6/Flopy+really large number of params+IES, what I think of as the ""even newer paradigm"". This is different from the normal workflow I use, the ""not so new anymore paradigm"":  PEST_HP + highly parameterized (<2000 param) + PLPROC + Pest Utilities + USG, where I face significant computational costs when building my JCO and the fact that USG it's not so friendly with outputs as MF6 is and the lack of real Flopy support for USG. 

Then one needs to decide if one to entirely switch to this new approach nor not, as there can be quite a lot of aspects to resolver first. In that sense, showing these tools being used in the ""not so new workflow"" can help people evaluate if switching completely is beneficial or not.

For me the most effective way of learning it's to apply all the things shown here to my own problem and be forced to solve my specific needs. Learning needs time, but the pressure of a deadline really makes things brain to learn quickly!

So, I guess this educational experience could be improved by somehow adding a ""work on your own thing at your own pace"" section and get some feedback from you guys along the way. This of course would require a a great commitment from the attendees, a longer timeframe and could probably a bit hard to implement due to confidentially issues (from our side) and also to avoid making this a consultancy project rather than learning a new approach experience.

Something like this:
  1) self-learning (see the notebooks as they are) - already done
  2) guided-learning (someone explaining the notebooks) - already done
  3) work on your own thing (discuss general approaches, and specific methods of pyemu, avoiding the actual site details)
5 weeks for 1) and 2)
10 weeks for 3) meeting three times (start, mid, end) / post questions.

Another thought, you may ask to people to commit to develop and send you guys a new notebook applying what they have learn to a new context/problem of their choosing or maybe of your choosing. As way of helping development the knowledge GMDSI is providing... or something along those lines..

Finally, for the next edition of this experience, I think I would spend more time on GitHub, explaining people how to use it. Especially because you suggested that all question/feedback should be submitted through that platform.

Thanks again. 
Hopefully a second version of this can happen and I'll be able to participate.
Cheers."
10/20/2023 3:32:56,this hybrid self-guided approach with few online meetings (as we have experienced now),I did a bit but fell behind,3,4,"This was an excellent format for such an intensive topic.  The mix of Katie and Mike was just right and provided a lot of information in a condensed time.  I doubt anyone could take more time for these sessions, so this high rate of information flow is unavoidable.  The recordings will be very valuable going forward as people work through the details, which will take time - months to years in my experience.  There were few questions, but each was valuable as Katie and Mike answered each very well.  This is like drinking from a firehose and it will take time for it to sink in (to use two metaphors in one sentence).  Keep up the good work and repeat as you have time."

However the discussion was very informative, and it improved my knowledge about PEST++. Wish we could have another session, maybe show the results from a real site, particularly about the optimizations. Thank you again for your time."

I am still in a state such that I only really understand about 1/4 of what you are talking about each time, but usually after the 4th time watching it I am starting to feel like I get it."

I didn't always have time to do more than click through the notebooks, falling a bit behind by the end. However, I really appreciated the opportunity to ask questions, as I ran in to all sorts of trouble trying to follow the notebooks but for a model I am working on. Many thanks again for the opportunity."

10/23/2023 22:36:49,this hybrid self-guided approach with few online meetings (as we have experienced now),I did a bit but fell behind,4,3,"I really enjoyed the experience. Nice teachers. Excellent shared workbooks. The classes helped me to better understand theoretical concepts about PEST and uncertainty analysis. However, because at the same time I need to work (I'm a senior modeler consultant), was very difficult to me to spend time in the workbooks. This is not a problem of the course, indeed. I'm just giving and idea of how my experience was, and I think could be something that happened to another people who is in the same position than me.
I would be willing to pay to have more time to develop the workbooks and the chance to have personal meetings with the teachers, or may be with a reduced number of people, let's say 3 to 5. Also, I would suggest to include some kind of test or evaluations, may be in a presentation form. Obviously, I'm not meaning you will provide some kind ""title"" of ""degree"" after the course, but I think the evaluations would motivate a more interactive participation.
Another suggestion: I think the course is not for people without any knowledge about PEST or uncertainty analysis. I had been working with this tools a couple of years and I feel the course was very useful to me since discussions allowed me to solve a number of doubts that I had. However, I think people without a previous knowledge felt a little bit lost with most of the topics we talked about in the meetings (I know a few).
Thank you very much for the initiative and I hope you share more of this kind of courses in the future.

Thanks for all your effort and work. The course was very solid and educational.
A thing that I would like to see in the course is more practical examples of applications.

Really enjoyed the session on MOU and would like to learn more about this for my projects."
